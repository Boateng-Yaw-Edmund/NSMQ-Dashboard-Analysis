# NSMQ-Dashboard-Analysis
![nsmq](https://github.com/Boateng-Yaw-Edmund/NSMQ-Dashboard-Analysis/blob/main/NSMQ/nsmq.jpg)

Power BI analysis of Ghana’s National Science &amp; Maths Quiz (2016–2024). Explores school dominance, regional strength, gender representation, and competitiveness with interactive visuals and KPIs.


## 🔍 Project Objective

To analyze NSMQ data from the 1/8 stage upwards and uncover insights on:
- Which schools and regions dominate the competition
- How gender representation looks across Mixed, Boys, and Girls schools
- The scoring power and competitiveness at different stages
- Regional distribution of advancement and wins


## 🧮 Main KPIs

- **Total Schools Represented (2016–2024)**: Unique schools that participated.
- **Championship Titles**: Total wins by schools at the Final stage.
- **Average Winning Score**: Average points scored by champions in the Finals.
- **Average Scores by Year & Gender**: Trend comparison across 8 years.
- **Stage Advancement by Region**: Number of schools per region reaching Quarter, Semi, Final.


## 🛠️ Project Process

1. **Data Cleaning & Prep**  
   - Handled nulls with replacement (for example, “No”, “None”, “Others”).
   - Created Stage_Label mapping (1/8 Final, Quarter, Semi, Final) for better visuals.
   - Built measures for advancement, wins, and average scores

2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Applied DAX measures (such as Total Wins, Avg_Winning_Points).
   - Structured calculations for school dominance, gender breakdowns, and competitiveness.

3. **Visualization Design**  
   - Clustered bar charts for Stage Advancement by Region.
   - Line charts for Gender-based scoring trends.
   - KPI Cards for Total Schools, Average Winning Score.
   - Ghana-focused filled map for Regional Wins.
   - Rounded bar hack (error bars) for polished visuals.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- **School Dominance** Certain schools consistently rack up high points, showing scoring power beyond just wins.
- **Regional Strength** Greater Accra and Central dominate wins, but other regions consistently push schools into Quarters and Semis.
- **Gender Representation** Boys’ schools dominate participation, but Girls’ schools are making strong runs into Semis and Finals.
- **Competitiveness** Some contests are nail-bitingly close (margin under 5 points), showing how tight the competition can get.


## 📌 Conclusion & Recommendations

### ✅ Conclusion
The NSMQ dashboard highlights patterns in dominance, participation, and competitiveness. It shows that while some regions and schools maintain strong dominance, there are rising challengers and stories of resilience, particularly from Girls’ schools and regions outside the big two.

This project demonstrates how data visualization can reveal clarity beyond raw numbers, making it easier to understand performance, identify gaps, and appreciate the dynamics of one of Ghana’s biggest academic events.

### 💡 Recommendations
- **Strengthen Regional Balance**  
  Support underrepresented regions with more resources and teacher training so they can compete at the higher stages.

- **Encourage Girls’ Schools Participation**  
  Invest in mentorship and STEM programs to boost girls’ schools’ performance since data shows fewer but strong contenders.

- **Reward Consistency Beyond Wins**  
  Recognize schools that consistently reach Quarter and Semi-finals, not only those that win, to broaden motivation.
  
- **Analyze Close Contests**  
  Close margins highlight competitiveness. Organizers could study these to improve question fairness and contest balance.
